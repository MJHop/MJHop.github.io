## From Joe's Unsolved Carjackings with no PODs

Related Memo from Joe: [Uncleared carjacking cases - no POD tie - distance to cams - Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PjFMkEpn_qiTjJjuqFhcHIQJtlufeORTxeCTlI7LmXY/edit)  
Original: [carjacking_2023_uncleared_no_POD_tie_distance_cam_slim - Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15oY_UdzM5j7KhzhzAhP5vQZmQBv-k1mR9-S8y04_nxM/edit#gid=1466988234)

I made a pivot table based on address of POD by count and filtered it to only records with a POD distance of less than 1,500 to see if there is a good POD that has had a lot that we can look at.

#### 7410 S LAFAYETTE AVE

Has 7 rows  in Joe's data of unsolved carjackings with no POD connections
Not on "no pulls" list of cameras

### Notes for Joe
So out of the seven case files above, the only one that specifically says it did use POD video is the last one (JG552909). I included info on which of the other ones mention POD videos in general just in case it is helpful but I don't have any reason to believe that those shouldn't be included in our larger dataset of cases without POD tie-ins. 

The CPD reports are all combined to one PDF which you can see [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1C6fiPX2imfTv-Hiq2lfPbdMWQ7_4UooB/view?usp=sharing). The records for JG552909 start on pg. 48. I've included screenshots of the relevant parts.
