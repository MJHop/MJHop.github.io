### This is to get an update on all of the FOIAs Joe asked me to file to get our data through the end of 2023

```ad-email
title: Summary from Joe 2024-02-22

I think (think) the only thing we're missing is the request related to inventory data provided in homicides and carjackings. As I recall, CPD (in separate FOIAs) provided three tabs of data for each:

-any RD with an incident/ supplemental report containing the word POD

-any arrest report containing the word POD

-any inventory with the word POD

  

The problem? That third tab, we found out, appeared to contain _any_ RD with an audio/ visual inventory -- including PODs but often other stuff too (like cell phones/ etc). That left us over-counting POD ties. So we asked CPD to give us one more field of data ("Inventory Description -- like it did in the POD arrests dataset). And we threw a hail mary, asking that perhaps they re-run the homicide and carjacking one together, and simply for _every_ crime. We hoped to get the whole enchilada of POD use, for all crimes, regardless of whether they were closed or not.

  

Anyway, I did that quick recap just to keep my brain straight on this stuff. Any word on that request? And am I missing anything?

##### Comms Update - Messages through portal for 2024003 (P910298-011624)
I sent a message through the portal for [[2024003|2024003]] asking for them to update this data and [[2023120|2023120]] on 2024-02-07. No response as of 2024-02-22, so I followed up in portal again.

```ad-email
title: 2024-02-07 portal message

After reviewing records received through FOIAs **P905660** and **P910298**, and comparing it to data received through earlier FOIA request (**P895674**), I saw there are some records that don’t show up in both as they should and others that are excluded. This concerns me that there may be some reasons as to why records were included in one response but not the other that I can't see from the data available. In addition, the "Inventory Description" field that was provided in the P895674 response allows me to see more information about why that row was include or not, but I don't have that field on the two most recent responses. 

So I'm wondering if it would be possible for DFA to re-run of these responses to include the additional field of "Inventory Descrption"? That will help me narrow down the list. Another option, if DFA would prefer, is to do one re-run of every IUCR (instead of just homicides and carjackkings) with that extra field and I will seperate out by IUCR as needed for my purposes.

Hello,

I am following up on this. Has anyone been able to view the questions I sent over on Feb. 7 yet?

Thank you,
