### This is a page to gather updates on all of the FOIAs Joe asked me to file to get our data through the end of 2023

```ad-email
title: Summary from Joe 2024-02-22

I think (think) the only thing we're missing is the request related to inventory data provided in homicides and carjackings. As I recall, CPD (in separate FOIAs) provided three tabs of data for each:

-any RD with an incident/ supplemental report containing the word POD

-any arrest report containing the word POD

-any inventory with the word POD

  

The problem? That third tab, we found out, appeared to contain _any_ RD with an audio/ visual inventory -- including PODs but often other stuff too (like cell phones/ etc). That left us over-counting POD ties. So we asked CPD to give us one more field of data ("Inventory Description -- like it did in the POD arrests dataset). And we threw a hail mary, asking that perhaps they re-run the homicide and carjacking one together, and simply for _every_ crime. We hoped to get the whole enchilada of POD use, for all crimes, regardless of whether they were closed or not.

  

Anyway, I did that quick recap just to keep my brain straight on this stuff. Any word on that request? And am I missing anything?

  

Joe

### Communications
##### Comms Update - Messages through portal for 2024003 (P910298-011624)
I sent a message through the portal for [[2024003|2024003]] asking for them to update this data and [[2023120|2023120]] on 2024-02-07. No response as of 2024-02-22, so I followed up in portal again.

```ad-email
title: 2024-02-07 portal message

After reviewing records received through FOIAs **P905660** and **P910298**, and comparing it to data received through earlier FOIA request (**P895674**), I saw there are some records that don’t show up in both as they should and others that are excluded. This concerns me that there may be some reasons as to why records were included in one response but not the other that I can't see from the data available. In addition, the "Inventory Description" field that was provided in the P895674 response allows me to see more information about why that row was include or not, but I don't have that field on the two most recent responses. 

So I'm wondering if it would be possible for DFA to re-run of these responses to include the additional field of "Inventory Descrption"? That will help me narrow down the list. Another option, if DFA would prefer, is to do one re-run of every IUCR (instead of just homicides and carjackkings) with that extra field and I will seperate out by IUCR as needed for my purposes.

Thank you,

*I called CPD FOIA line multiple times, no response, mailbox was full. Called PSA and they emailed CPD FOIA Officer Edwards to ask him to call me.*

```ad-summary
title: [[2024-02-29]] | 09:54 am call from Edwards - CPD FOIA

Seargent Edwards called from 312-745-5309, calling me back from my calls yesterday. This is about the additional fields we asked for from 2023120 and 2024003. He said that because we asked for an expanded time frame and the additional fields, DFA said that they would have to look through more than 100k rows in the Inventory Description field to see what would need to be redacted. This is because in those fields they say things like victim's names and juvenile names. I asked why that would be an issue with this request when we have received Inventory Description fields in the past. He said he wasn't sure but that it might be because of the time frame expansion to the early data (2003-06ish) includes more personal information in the Inventory Description than what is common now. I asked him to just send me what DFA sent him so I could review it and share with our data reporter and he said he could share the first part, but the second portion includes non-redacted examples of what would need to be redacted in the Inventory Description field so he can't share that. I said that's fine, just share the first part and we'll go from there.

Hi Madison,

  

It was great talking to you today.

  

  

Response from DFA

  

"We ran the data according to the requester's specifications.  Request no. 20794 - P895674 yielded more records since the requester provided more terms that we needed to search, and the data range was as of Jan. 1, 2003.  For the other two tasks, we ran POD as requested as well as Police Observation Device, and the date range was as of Jan. 1, 2006."

  

  

 We do not have an automated way of redacting people's names in the inventory description . For example, in task no. 20794 - P895674 (157,366 rows of data).

  

Examples:

  

·         Inventory description contained outcry witness name

  

·         Inventory description name of offender (we don't know if offender is a juvenile or adult unless we look up the CB.

  

·          Inventory Description of disc contained victim's name.   

  

I hope this helps.

  

Sincerely,
